                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>That is a very basic question, but I suppose you're entitled to it. My name is <u>Liam O'Brien</u>,
                    which you can also see if you check out that convenient little footer at the bottom of the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>What's my deal?</h2>
                <p>There's a lot of ways to answer this question, but I'll just focus on one: I like efficiency. If I've 
                    already spent time developing website components, I'll happily recycle them to speed up the development
                    process later. I also have a difficult time talking about myself, as evidenced by this entire page.
                </p>
                <h2>What about basic bio information?</h2>
                <p>Oh, yeah, I can do that. I'm a CIS major at Bradley University. I was born and raised just over the 
                    river from there in East Peoria, IL. My hobbies include book things, computer things, dungeons and dragons
                    every once in a while, and remaining very attached to my former FIRST robotics team, 2481 Roboteers.
                </p>
                <h2>Do I have any weirdly specific opinions on package delivery companies?</h2>
                <p>Why yes, I do, I'm glad you asked! Observe:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>USPS: The gold standard. They might always have financial issues (because of Congress), but they get
                        the job done well and on time, and they bring postal service to some truly ludicrous places. Plus, they're
                        the only people legally allowed to deliver to mailboxes. That's pretty neat.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        UPS: Losing that single "S" from their name takes them down a notch, but there's potential here. Your
                        packages might go through the ringer, but they keep a good schedule. If they say it'll be there Friday,
                        it'll be there Friday. They also treat their drivers well and promote up from within the company, so that's
                        nice.
                    </li>
                    <li>Amazon: True, a lot of what comes from Amazon is delivered by other companies, but they handle a good
                        amount themselves too. They're usually pretty solid, but if your package gets delayed once it is likely
                        to be delayed again. Don't always trust their delivery estimates. Line worker conditions are much better
                        than UPS though, but drivers are a different story. It's not nearly as sweet a gig for them.
                    </li>
                    <li>DHS Logistics: A bit of an up and comer, in my opinion, though I honestly have no idea how big they are.
                        I haven't interacted with them much, but they seem broadly competent.
                    </li>
                    <li>Hand Delivery: Delivering a package yourself may be tedious, but it's better than the next option.</li>
                    <li>Fedex: I have a burning hatred for this company. Every interaction I've had with them has been bad, or at best,
                        worse than any of their competitors. Their delivery estimates are a joke, and will fluctuate like crazy without
                        any meaning. Their hiring process is slower than molasses. They <em>also</em> have a bad relationship with their drivers.
                        They do one cool thing with their logo and then coast on their reputation. Avoid this company if at all possible.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Anyway, those are my opinions on that.</p>

                <p>This is an older photo of me holding one of my cats, Faith. It's the only photo of me on this laptop, 
                    and I felt like this page could use a picture to make it more interesting.
